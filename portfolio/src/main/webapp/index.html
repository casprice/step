      <p>Hi! I’m a rising junior at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science.
         I’m currently working from home as a STEP Engineering Intern at 
         Google and am serving as President of the ACM chapter at UC San 
         Diego.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a software developer from San Gabriel, CA. I'm currently working
         from home as a Google STEP intern, but I am also an undergraduate 
         student attending UC San Diego.</p>
      <p>I first started learning about the underlying components of a web page
         in middle school. However, it wasn’t until my senior year of high 
         school that I formalized my learning of Computer Science through my AP
         CS class and by following online web development tutorials. 
      </p>

        <div id="about-text">
          <p>Nowadays, I love exploring the many different facets of Computer
             Science by attending hackathons, writing software for my robotics
             lab, and learning the math and engineering behind artificial 
             intelligence. I also enjoy bringing this knowledge to my peers 
             through my student org, ACM UCSD, because I know how 
             overwhelming it can be to get started in such a vast field. In 
             fact, one of my goals for the 2020-21 school year is to start up
             an outreach program within ACM UCSD, to help familiarize young 
             students and minorities in tech run with CS fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p>In my free time, my favorite things to do include running and 
             hiking with friends, reading, and solving crossword puzzles with 
             my sister.
          </p>
          <p>If you’re interested in getting in touch, I’d love to chat with 
             you! Feel free to check out my resume or email me below.
