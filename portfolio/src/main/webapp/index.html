      <p>Hi! I’m a rising junior at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science.
         I’m currently working from home as a STEP Engineering Intern at 
         Google and am serving as President of the ACM chapter at UC San 
         Diego.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a software developer from San Gabriel, CA. I'm currently working
         from home as a Google STEP intern, but I am also an undergraduate 
         student attending UC San Diego.</p>
      <p>I first started learning about the underlying components of a web page
         in middle school. However, it wasn’t until my senior year of high 
         school that I formalized my learning of Computer Science through my AP
         CS class and by following online web development tutorials. 
      </p>
      <div class="flex-img-text">
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>Nowadays, I love exploring the many different facets of Computer
             Science by attending hackathons, writing software for my robotics
             lab, and learning the math and engineering behind artificial 
             intelligence. I also enjoy bringing this knowledge to my peers 
             through my student org, ACM UCSD, because I know how 
             overwhelming it can be to get started in such a vast field. In 
             fact, one of my goals for the 2020-21 school year is to start up
             an outreach program within ACM UCSD, to help familiarize young 
             students and minorities in tech run with CS fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p>In my free time, my favorite things to do include running and 
             hiking with friends, reading, and solving crossword puzzles with 
             my sister.
          </p>
          <p>If you’re interested in getting in touch, I’d love to chat with 
             you! Feel free to check out my resume or email me below.

            <p>I began my term in ACM as part of the founding team and as the
               role Vice President Internal. I oversaw the execution of over 
               120 events, from technical workshops to community-building 
               socials, in our first year as a student organization. I also 
               established much of our logistics pipeline to ensure a smooth 
               internal workflow. Now, as President I lead over 50 officers 
               across the boards of ACM UCSD and its 5 special interest 
               groups, which are separate child organizations at UCSD focused 
               on specific fields in the computing world.</p>

            <p>I spent the summer of 2019 working with a team of graduate and 
               undergraduate engineers designing and building a mobile 
               serpentine robot configured for deep ocean and extraterrestrial
               exploration. My contributions involved engineering software 
               architecture interfaced with ROS to direct and regulate the 
               robot, and developing external controsl on a remote desktop. 
               This project was funded by NASA JPL under their 2018-2019 
               Spontaneous Concept Award, and our research paper was accepted 
               by the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 
               2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I am working to develop the robot’s movement controls 
              further by writing high-level motion planner algorithms to 
              process and filter sensor data.
